University students often work on projects or write mandatory theses, which require finding a professor who can serve as their supervisor. Professors at the university might already have ideas for potential student projects that they want to communicate. Thus, every semester there is a challenge of providing awareness of both project ideas and supervision needs.

ProjectBank has three different roles, an "Admin", a "Supervisor", and a normal user (i.e. a student). The admin has the ability to manage the different university specific TagGroups and create projects. The supervisor has the ability to create projects. Lastly, all users have the ability to filter projects.
