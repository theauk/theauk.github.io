Services like Google Scholar provide bibliographic information for scholarly resources such as journals, papers, theses and dissertations. However, when using these services it can be difficult for the user to do any task besides searching. The Literature Explorer allows the user to explore relationships between scholarly resources through an interactive graph. This includes:

- Performing a search and seeing a graph illustration for their selected paper (paper as nodes and citations as edges). 
- Interacting with the graph and get more information about each resource. 
- Creating and customizing a graph of their own by creating their own connections between papers.
