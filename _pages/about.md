I am an incoming M.S. in Computer Science student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.uci.edu/) at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). I am excited about systems security and distributed systems. 

I received a B.S. in Software Development from the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/) with a semester abroad at the [American University in Cairo](https://www.aucegypt.edu/).

Outside academics, I have been a software engineer intern at J.P. Morgan and Microsoft. I have also had the opportunity to live in six different countries:Â Denmark, USA, South Korea, Scotland, Ireland, and Egypt.
