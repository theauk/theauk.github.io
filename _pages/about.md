I am a MSc in Computer Science student at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) supported by the [Thanks to Scandinavia](https://www.thankstoscandinavia.org/class-of-2023-us/) Foundation (selected by Fulbright Denmark). I am excited about softare and systems security. At UCI, I am currently doing research in security and privacy for emerging technologies.

I received a BSc in Software Development from the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/) with a semester abroad at the [American University in Cairo](https://www.aucegypt.edu/).

Outside academics, I have been a software engineer intern at J.P. Morgan and Microsoft. I have also had the opportunity to live in six different countries: Denmark, USA, South Korea, Scotland (UK), Ireland, and Egypt. I can often be found hiking or (trail) running.

*I will be at ETH Zürich for the upcoming summer as a research intern in the [Advanced Software Technologies Lab](https://ast.ethz.ch/)!*
